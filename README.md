## About Me   

Hi there! 👋 I’m **Kobe Chang**, currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems** at **Singapore Management University (SMU)** from **2024 – 2028**.

I am particularly interested in Data Analytics and Technology-driven problem solving , where I enjoy working with data to uncover insights, improve decision-making, and optimise processes. My interests include:

- 📊 Data analysis and visualisation  
- 🧠 Translating data into actionable business insights  
- ⚙️ Building data-driven applications and automation tools  
- 🌐 Understanding how systems, data, and users interact in real-world contexts  

Through my academic projects and hands-on experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in **programming, databases, and analytics**, and I enjoy continuously learning new tools and technologies to strengthen my skill set.

## ✅ Completed Projects  

### ⭐ Main Project  

#### 📈 **MTF GUI (Python-based GUI Application)**  

**Objective**  
- Create a GUI to present **MTF data and curves** for all lenses in a wafer  

**Problems Identified**
- Legacy **VBA GUI was difficult to maintain**
- Manual analysis required for **large volumes of wafers**

**Solution**
- Replaced VBA-based GUI with a **Python GUI using Tkinter**
- Improved maintainability, performance, and usability

**Key Contributions**
- Developed Python scripts to compute and visualize **MTF data**
- Built a user-friendly GUI for engineers to analyze wafer-level data
- Reduced dependency on fragile VBA code

### 🔧 Supplementary Projects  

#### 📄 **Control Plan Automation (Excel)**  
- Built VBA scripts to **automatically copy and generate processes**
- Eliminated repetitive manual Excel work  
- ⏱️ **99% time saved** (from 1–2 days → 10–15 minutes)

---

#### 🖼️ **PDF Image Processing Script**  
- Processed images from PDF files using Python  
- Extracted:
  - Top view images  
  - Side view images  
- Superimposed **Y-distance values**, **ISO**, and **SA** metrics  

📉 **Efficiency Gain**
- ⏱️ **40% time saved per image** (60s → 36s)  
- Engineers process ~50 images in ~1.5 hours  

---

#### 🧪 **Test Reject GUI**  
- Compared **serial numbers** from:
  - 2DBC files  
  - Mphase files  
- Displayed:
  - Bin numbers  
  - Units not found  
- Improved accuracy and troubleshooting speed

---

#### 📊 **Angel Wings Form Error Plot**  
- Created Python scripts to visualize **form error patterns**
- Enabled faster defect identification through plotting
