#### 📈 **MTF GUI (Python-based GUI Application)**  

**Objective**  
- Create a GUI to present **MTF data and curves** for all lenses in a wafer  

**Problems Identified**
- Legacy **VBA GUI was difficult to maintain**
- Manual analysis required for **large volumes of wafers**

**Solution**
- Replaced VBA-based GUI with a **Python GUI using Tkinter**
- Improved maintainability, performance, and usability

**Key Contributions**
- Developed Python scripts to compute and visualize **MTF data**
- Built a user-friendly GUI for engineers to analyze wafer-level data
- Reduced dependency on fragile VBA code

---

#### 📄 **Control Plan Automation (Excel)**  
- Built VBA scripts to **automatically copy and generate processes**
- Eliminated repetitive manual Excel work  
- ⏱️ **99% time saved** (from 1–2 days → 10–15 minutes)

---

#### 🖼️ **PDF Image Processing Script**  
- Processed images from PDF files using Python  
- Extracted:
